Founding Engineer - Take Home Assignment
Disaster Response Coordination Platform
Submission Window: 48 Hours
Tech Stack: Candidate's Choice
Objective
Build a small backend-focused disaster response platform that allows users to create disaster incidents, resolve their locations, find nearby resources, and retrieve community reports.
The objective is to evaluate your ability to design APIs, model data, integrate external services, handle failures, optimize requests, and write maintainable code.
You are free to choose your technology stack.
1. Disaster Management
Implement APIs to:
POST   /disasters
GET    /disasters
GET    /disasters/:id
PATCH  /disasters/:id
DELETE /disasters/:id
A disaster should contain:
id
title
description
location
tags
status
created_by
created_at
updated_at
Support basic filtering, for example:
GET /disasters?tag=flood
Include basic validation and error handling.
2. Location Resolution
When creating a disaster, the system should be able to determine its location from the description.
Example:
"Heavy flooding has affected Manhattan, NYC."
The system should extract/identify:
Manhattan, NYC
and resolve it to:
latitude
longitude
You may use any suitable:
LLM/AI service
Geocoding service
Mapping provider
Mock service
External API keys are not mandatory. A clean mock/fallback implementation is acceptable.
3. Nearby Resources
Create a resource model containing:
id
name
type
location
Example resource types:
shelter
hospital
food
water
rescue
Implement:
GET /disasters/:id/resources?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>&radius=<km>
Return resources within the requested radius.
Use an appropriate geospatial approach for your chosen database.
Explain briefly in your README how your solution performs the location-based search.
4. Community Reports
Implement:
GET /disasters/:id/reports
Reports may come from a mock external social-media service.
Example:
{
  "content": "Need drinking water near Manhattan",
  "user": "citizen123",
  "created_at": "..."
}
You do not need real Twitter/X access.
Focus on:
Fetching external data
Normalizing the response
Handling external API failures
Avoiding unnecessary repeated API calls
5. Caching
Cache the response from at least one external service.
You may use:
Redis
Database
In-memory cache
Any suitable solution
The flow should be:
Request
   ↓
Check Cache
   ↓
Cache Hit → Return Cached Data
   ↓
Cache Miss
   ↓
External Service
   ↓
Store Response
   ↓
Return Response
Use a reasonable TTL.
Briefly explain your caching strategy in the README.
6. Real-Time Update
Implement a basic real-time mechanism using:
WebSocket
Socket.IO
Server-Sent Events
Equivalent technology
Emit an event whenever a disaster is created or updated.
Example:
disaster_updated
A minimal client/test demonstrating the event is sufficient.
7. Authentication & Authorization
Implement lightweight authentication using any reasonable approach.
You may use mock users.
Example:
admin
contributor
Demonstrate at least one authorization rule.
For example:
admin → create/update/delete
contributor → create/update
A production-grade authentication system is not required.
8. What We Expect
We are primarily evaluating:
API design
Code structure
Database design
Validation
Error handling
External API integration
Caching
Geospatial querying
Real-time communication
Authentication/authorization
Testing
Engineering judgment
A polished frontend is not required.
A simple frontend, Postman collection, Swagger documentation, or API client is sufficient to demonstrate functionality.
9. Testing
Include tests for at least:
One API endpoint
One validation/error scenario
One important business rule
One external integration/mock
You do not need complete test coverage.
10. README
Your README should contain:
Setup
How to run the project locally.
Architecture
A simple diagram or explanation of the major components.
Technical Decisions
Briefly explain:
Why you selected your database
How your geospatial search works
How caching works
How external API failures are handled
Trade-offs
Mention anything you intentionally simplified or left incomplete.
AI Usage
AI coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. are allowed.
Mention briefly:
Tool used:
What it helped with:
What was manually implemented/modified:
We will evaluate your understanding of the submitted code, not how much code was generated.
Bonus — Optional
Implement one of the following if you have additional time:
AI-based image verification
Official disaster updates
Priority classification of reports
Interactive map
Background job/queue for external API processing
Do not sacrifice the core requirements for bonus features.
Submission
Please provide:
GitHub repository
README
.env.example
API documentation / Postman collection
Live demo, if available
Any mock data/setup scripts required to run the project
Do not commit API keys or secrets.

Final Note
You have 48 hours to submit the assignment.
We are not expecting a production-ready disaster management system.
We are interested in how you approach a real engineering problem, make technical decisions, handle edge cases, and structure your solution.
Build less. Think deeply. Explain your decisions.
